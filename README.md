# Zillow Track

## Ideas

Originating from the recent experience of housing picking. We did a lot of house looking from Zillow and pick out candidates house and went to open house or visit house with an agent. However, we haven't found our best house, and it's hard to track the house market day to day. So I want to build an application to monitoring the new houses coming out in Pittsburgh area and predict how much we would like to see the house in person. Once the grades surpass the threshold, there will be an email reminder sending to our email.

## Outlines

Borrow framework from [A Data Science Framework: To Achieve 99% Accuracy](https://www.kaggle.com/ldfreeman3/a-data-science-framework-to-achieve-99-accuracy)

### Define the problem

Predict the likelihood that a new house shown on Zillow would attract us for a house visiting.

### Gather the data

Two options:

- Web Scrape
- Zillow API

### Prepare Data Consumption

- Clean data
- Feature Engineering

### Model Data

### Validate and Implement Data Model

### Optimize and Strategize

### other function

- How to input the area for search house? Zip code, area name, or city name?
- How to absorb new data every day/ every hour from Zillow and how to update the model?
- How to send the reminder to user?
- Any user dashboard needed to be build?

## Task VIP plan (proof of concept)

Gather data: first two days
Building model: two more days
Set up a server and deploy machine learning model: 2 days
Set up user reminder and daily fresh for data and model: 2 days
