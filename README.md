# ZillowTrack

## Ideas

Originating from the recent experience of housing picking. We did a lot of house looking from Zillow and pick out candidates house and went to openhouse or visit house with an agent. However, we havn't find our best house and it's hard to track the house market day to day. So I want to build an application to monitoring the new houses coming out in Pittsburgh area and predict how much we would like to see the house in person. Once the grades surpass the shreshold, there will be an email reminder sending to our email.
